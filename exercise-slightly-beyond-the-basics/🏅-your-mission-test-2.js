// âœ… TASK: Create another test against the 'validateUser' method of the 'usersService':
//    Don't pass anything to the function and ensure it throws back an exception
// ðŸ’¡ TIP: The expect assertion expect(someMethod).toThrow can be helpful:
//    https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tothrowerror

// âœ… TASK: Create the first test against the 'addUser' method of the 'usersService':
//    Pass a valid input and expect a positive response back
// ðŸ’¡ TIP: The code under test is an async method, your test must await for a response

// âœ… TASK: Create the first test against the 'deleteUser' method of the 'usersService':
//    ensure than a user is deleted the response is positive
// ðŸ’¡ TIP: This method returns a callback, hence the test must accept a 'done' function as a param and then
//    it should call done() right after the assertion line
//    Code example: test('title', (done) => {done()});


//ðŸŽ– CONGRATS. You have internalized the anatomy of software testing. This knowledge can be replicated to write many type
//of tests including advanced frontend and backend testing. You now have the weapon to move faster, refactor more,
//and generate great docs! Nota that there is much left to learn ðŸ“—
